#Limit Tabs for Sublime Text

Ever get to the end (middle?) of a day of coding only to find your window littered with tabs that are nearly impossible to search through visually? Find yourself rage-quitting all your tabs in disgust and starting over? No? Just me? Ok.

With this plugin, a simple keystroke `ctrl + alt + w` will close all tabs, the oldest first, whose file has not been modified in the last 30 minutes (to change this interval, see Preferences > Packages > LimitTabs > Settings). It will keep 10 tabs open (also changeable in settings) and will only close tabs in the background â€“ so files that are open and active in your window won't be closed. Likewise, it will not close files with unsaved changes.

You can change the key binding in Preferences > Package Settings > LimitTabs > Key Bindings.

##Run automatically

You can also configure the plugin to automatically close old tabs each time you save a file. To enable this, go to Preferences > Package Settings > LimitTabs > Settings and set `limittabs_run_on_post_save` to `true`:

~~~js
// Automatically run after a file is saved
"limittabs_run_on_post_save": true,
~~~

##Threshold

Another configuration option is the **threshold**. Setting this to 0 disables this plugin, a number greater than 0 will keep always at least this amount of tabs open

~~~js
// If this is set and greater than 0, LimitTabs will only run if
// the number of tabs is greater than the threshold setting.
"limittabs_threshold": 12,
~~~

##Keep open minimum files

The setting variable **keep_open** lets you choose a number of tabs that will always kept open

~~~js
// Keep this amount of tabs open. Tabs are closed by last access time
// or last modified time, whatever is higher
"limittabs_threshold": 10
~~~

##Installation with Package Manager (Recommended)

The easiest way to install is via the excellent [Sublime Package Manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation). Once Package Manager is installed, bring up the commands menu (`Command + Shift + P` on Mac, `Control + Shift + P` on Windows or Linux), then type "Package Control" to filter the commands list. Select the "Package Control: Install Package" command, then find and install the LimitTabs plugin.

##Installation without Package Manager
Clone or download this repo to your **Packages** folder.
